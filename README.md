# Create a message post system. New messages will be posted on a DynamoDB table. Include timestamp, who posted, and the message. Using Database streams and triggers, send out an SNS message to a subscriber list with the post and other data. Also, provide a field that states it is a reply to a previous message. Send this to SNS when it is replied but include the original message as well.
